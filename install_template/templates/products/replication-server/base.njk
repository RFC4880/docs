!!!note
   When Replication Server is installed on a machine where Java is not present, the JDK is installed as part of the installation process. Since in this case the JDK was installed via Replication Server as its dependency, if you subsequently remove the JDK, Replication Server is also removed. 

   If Java 1.8 or greater exists before installing Replication Server, the installed Replication Server is not removed on removal of the JDK.

You can install all Replication Server components with a single install command, or you may choose to install selected, individual components by installing only those particular packages.

To install all Replication Server components:

```shell
sudo {{ packageManager }}  -y install {{ packageName }}
```

To install an individual component:
```shell
sudo {{ packageManager }}  -y install <package_name>
```

Where `<package_name>` is:

| Package name          | Component                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edb-xdb-console`     | Replication console and the Replication Server command line interface |
| `edb-xdb-publisher`   | Publication server                                                    |
| `edb-xdb-subscriber`  | Subscription server                                                   |
