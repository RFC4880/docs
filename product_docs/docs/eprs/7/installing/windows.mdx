EDB provides an interactive installer for Windows on the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#replication-server). 

After downloading the installer, you can either invoke it directly or by using Stack Builder (with PostgreSQL) or StackBuilder Plus (with EDB Postgres Advanced Server). 




## Prerequisites

- You must have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or later installed on the hosts where you intend to install any Replication Server component (Replication Console, publication server, or subscription server). Any Java product such as Oracle Java or OpenJDK may be used. Follow the directions for your host operating system to install the Java runtime.

- Be sure the system environment variable, `JAVA_HOME`, is set to the JRE installation directory of the JRE version and bitness (32-bit or 64-bit) you wish to use with the Replication Server. The Replication Server installer for a Windows platform contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The `JAVA_HOME` setting determines whether the 32-bit or the 64-bit version of Replication Server is installed. (If `JAVA_HOME` is not set, then the first JRE version encountered in the Path system environment variable determines the Replication Server version to be installed.)

## Invoking the interactive installer

Either invoke the installer directly or with Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus.

### Invoking the interactive installer directly

To start the installation wizard, assume sufficient privileges (superuser or administrator) and double-click the installer icon. If prompted, provide a password.

In some versions of Windows, to invoke the installer with Administrator privileges, you need to right-click on the installer icon and select **Run as Administrator** from the context menu.

Proceed to the [Using the interactive installer](#using-the-interactive-installer) section.

### Invoking the interactive installer using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus

If you are using PostgreSQL, you can invoke the installer with Stack Builder. See [Using Stack Builder](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/03_using_stackbuilder/). Follow the prompts until you get to the module selection window, expand the Registration-Required and Trial Products node, expand the EnterpriseDB Tools node, and select Replication Server. Proceed to the [Using the interactive installer](#using-the-interactive-installer) section.

If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can invoke the installer with StackBuilder Plus. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](/epas/latest/epas_inst_windows/installing_advanced_server_with_the_interactive_installer/using_stackbuilder_plus/). Follow the prompts until you get to the module selection window, expand the EnterpriseDB Tools node and select Replication Server. Proceed to the [Using the interactive installer](#using-the-interactive-installer) section.

## Using the interactive installer 

1. Select the installation language and select **OK**.

1. On the Setup Replication Server screen, select **Next**.

1. Read the license agreement. If you accept the agreement, select the accept radio button and select **Next**.

1. Browse to a directory where you want the Replication Server components installed, or allow it to install the components in the default location. Select **Next**.

1. If you do not want a particular Replication Server component installed on this particular host, uncheck the box next to the component name. Select **Next**.

1. On the Account Registration screen, select the radio button that applies to you. Select **Next**.

   - If you do not have an EnterpriseDB user account, you will be directed to the registration page of the EnterpriseDB website.

   - If you already have an EnterpriseDB user account, enter the email address and password for your EnterpriseDB user account. Select **Next**.

1. Enter information for the Replication Server administrator.

   !!! Note
       From this point on, we suggest you record the values you enter as they will be needed during the publication and subscription server registration process.

   Enter values for the following fields:

    -   **Admin User** &mdash; The Replication Server administrator user name to authenticate certain usage of the Replication Server such as registering a publication server or a subscription server running on this host. Any alphanumeric string may be entered for the admin user name. The default admin user name is admin.

   -   `Admin Password.` &mdash; Password of your choice for the Replication Server administrator given in the Admin User field.

   The admin user and the admin password (in encrypted form) are saved to the `XDB_HOME\etc\edb-repl.conf` configuration file. Select **Next**.

1. (Only if publication server is a selected component): Enter an available port on which the publication server will run. Default port number is 9051. Select **Next**.

1. (Only if subscription server is a selected component): Enter an available port on which the subscription server will run. Default port number is 9052. Select **Next**.

1. For the operating system account under which the publication server or subscription server is to run, enter `postgres` or `enterprisedb` if you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server installed in Oracle compatible configuration mode.

1. On the Ready to Install screen, Select **Next**.

   An information box appears showing the installation progress of the Replication Server selected components. This may take a few minutes.

1. When installation has completed, select **Finish**.


Successful installation of Replication Server results in the creation of directory structures and files in your host environment as described in [Installation details](installation_details). Verify that the path to your Java runtime program set in `XDB_HOME\etc\edb-repl.conf` is correct.
