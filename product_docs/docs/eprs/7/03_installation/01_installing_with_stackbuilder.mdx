EDB provides an interactive installer for Windows. You can either install Replication Server using the interactive installer or use StackBuilder or StackBuilder Plus on PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server, respectively. Either approach requires you download the installer package.

See ... for details on using StackBuilder and ... for using StackBuilder Plus.

## Install using the interactive installer
### Prerequisites
- Download the installer
- You must have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or later installed on the hosts where you intend to install any Replication Server component (EPRS Replication Console, publication server, or subscription server). Any Java product such as Oracle Java or OpenJDK may be used. Follow the directions for your host operating system to install Java runtime.
- Be sure the system environment variable, `JAVA_HOME`, is set to the JRE installation directory of the JRE version and bitness (32-bit or 64-bit) you wish to use with the Replication Server. The Replication Server installer for a Windows platform contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The `JAVA_HOME` setting determines whether the 32-bit or the 64-bit version of Replication Server is installed. (If `JAVA_HOME` is not set, then the first JRE version encountered in the Path system environment variable determines the Replication Server version to be installed.)





   Follow the directions for your host operating system to install Java runtime.

**For Windows only:** 

   !!! Note
       For Advanced Server versions prior to 9.3, a Java runtime is supplied and installed as part of the Advanced Server installation process, however, you must still have pre-installed a separate Java runtime system on your host. The Replication Server installation process does not utilize the Java runtime supplied with Advanced Server.

   !!! Note
       After installation of Replication Server has completed, the path to your Java runtime program is stored in the Replication Server Startup Configuration file used by Replication Server. Verify that the path to your Java runtime program set in the Replication Server Startup Configuration file is correct. See [Installation details](03_installing_rpm_package/installation_details/) for the location of this file.

1. From the host’s application menu, open the Postgres menu and choose `Stack Builder` or `StackBuilder Plus`.
